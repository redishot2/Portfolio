# Under Construction
My portfolio site is currently under construction while I create it for the first time. 

# Old Website
My [old portfolio](http://natashamartinez.weebly.com/published-games.html) was a simple, drag-and-drop website creator hosted for free on Weebly. Weebly is a useful tool in getting yourself on the internet quickly and cheeply and while I loved how easy it was to keep updated, a developer not maintaining their own website seemed silly. Thus, my new and improved portfolio site.

# New Website
My [new Portfolio](http://natashamartinez.games/) is now proudly hosted and domain-controlled by me. It is made with HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap 3.0.
