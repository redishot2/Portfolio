# Portfolio
My website portfolio code

# Under Construction
My portfolio site is currently under construction while I create it for the first time. 

# Old Website
My [old portfolio](http://natashamartinez.weebly.com/published-games.html) was a simple, drag-and-drop website creator hosted for free on Weebly. Weebly is a useful tool in getting yourself on the internet quickly and cheeply and while I loved how easy it was to keep updated, a developer not maintaining their own website seemed silly. Thus, my new and improved portfolio site.

# New Website
My [new Portfolio](http://natashamartinez.games/) is now proudly hosted and domain-controlled by me. It is made with HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap 3.0. 

# Templates
In creating this project, I started out with a few bootstrap templates and modified them to fit my needs. This allowed me to get some fantastic design choices and quickly create my website. 
* [Landing Page](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/)
* [Portfolio Page](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/4-col-portfolio/)
* [Game Page](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/portfolio-item/)
